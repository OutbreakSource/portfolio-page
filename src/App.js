Leveraging React, I developed a product that incorporates a large dataset from ArtEmis to analyze emotions associated with images. Through a script, images were matched with corresponding emotions and used to train a Machine Learning model for emotion detection. Additionally, I implemented multiple feature algorithms to generate scores for each image, enabling the training of data tied to the provided emotions.",

                    Hello, I'm Daniel Martinez! I graduated from MSU Denver in December 2022 with a Bachelor's of Applied Sciences in Computer Science, along with a minor in Math. While I primarily code in Java and Python for smaller projects, I have recently ventured into React and am currently learning JavaScript. As a self-taught developer, my projects may not be overly complex, but they serve as important stepping stones for me to strengthen my front-end skills. Below, you'll find videos showcasing my recent projects. Please note that the volume might be low, so headphones are recommended for a better experience. Additionally, the left side of the videos provides context, explaining the purpose and story behind each project.
